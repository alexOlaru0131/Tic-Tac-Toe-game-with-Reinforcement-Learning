## About
This application is made to automatically process the future decisions in a Tic-Tac-Toe game and evaluate if it's a win or a loss based on the board.

## How to use
The game needs to be launched in the center of the screen in order for the algorithm to work well which is already done by default, but results may vary based on the screen resolution.

To get to project configuration using ESP-IDF run `idf.py set-target esp32` `idf.py menuconfig`
To build using ESP-IDF run `idf.py build`
To flash on the board run `idf.py -p PORT [-b BAUD] flash`
To run the IDF Monitor run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`
